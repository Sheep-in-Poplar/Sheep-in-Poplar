I'm glad to say hello to programmers in Github!
As you see, my Chinese name is 杨智博(Yang Zhibo), but if you'd like to call me English name, it is Michael, Michael Prophet Bars.

In fact, I am an amateur minecraft player in China and successfully established an organization called "HopeBuild" in 2020.
Unfortunately, it was dissolved in 2022, and most of its old members chose to join its "successor": concrete organization.

We have tried to build many cities in the Chinese version of minecraft represented by Netease in Chinese Mainland, but so far,
there are only two maps left. 
This is because, on the one hand, people often make trouble and destroy them during construction.
On the other hand, our ability to save maps is even worse.
We have basically solved the problem of destruction through a series of instructions, but there are still big problems in the preservation of maps.

So I chose GitHub.
At the same time, I have created twitter accounts and discord accounts, and set up servers in discord.
I hope that I can slowly associate with more foreign friends, so that we can have less confrontation and more unity.
